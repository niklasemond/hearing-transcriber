# Congressional Hearing Transcriber

A Flask-based web application that automatically transcribes congressional hearing audio files, identifies speakers, and generates analytical summaries. Built for researchers, journalists, and policy analysts working with congressional hearing recordings.

## Features
- High-accuracy speech-to-text transcription using OpenAI Whisper
- Automatic speaker identification and separation using Pyannote (not yet attributing the actual identity of the speaker)
- Web interface for easy file uploads (not yet tested) 
- Multiple output formats (JSON, TXT, SRT)
- Real-time processing status updates
- Secure file handling and storage (at your own risk)
